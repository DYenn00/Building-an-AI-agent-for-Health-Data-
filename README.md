# Building an AI agent for Health Care Data

I made a Health Data AI Explorer which is an AI agent that searches, acquires, processes, and visualizes health-related data interactively. This project demonstrates an AI-powered system that can automatically gather health data from sources like Google and Kaggle, process it, and generate interactive visualizations to explore insights in specific health domains and keywords.

## Features
1. Automated Data Acquisition – Searches and retrieves health-related datasets from online sources.
2. Data Processing & Cleaning – Prepares data for analysis with intelligent filtering and cleaning.
3. Interactive Visualizations – Generates dynamic charts and dashboards for exploring health trends.
4. Domain-Specific Focus – Allows users to query specific health topics or keywords.
5. Extensible & Modular – Easy to add new data sources or visualization types.


## Tech Stack
1. Programming Languages: Python
2. Data Processing and Storage: pandas for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values
3. Visualization Libraries: Plotly, Dash, Seaborn
4. Deployment: Streamlit, Flask, Docker
5. Version Control: GitHub


## Define Agent Scope for Health Data

- Clearly define the specific domain (e.g., 'public health statistics', 'disease prevalence', 'healthcare trends'), keywords (e.g., 'diabetes prevalence data', 'covid-19 cases dataset', 'global health indicators CSV'), and types of health data the AI agent should search for on Google and Kaggle. Specify the desired format and characteristics of this health data for visualization.

## Articulate Agent Scope for Health Data

This defines the domain, purpose, and high-level functionalities of the AI agent, specifically its role in searching for and visualizing health-related data. For example:

- Domain: Public health statistics, disease prevalence, healthcare trends.
- Purpose: To identify, analyze, and visualize global health indicators and disease patterns to inform public health initiatives.
- Functionalities: Search Google and Kaggle for datasets, identify relevant health metrics, and create interactive visualizations like trend lines, geographical maps, or comparative bar charts.

## Identify Key Health Data Categories and Keywords

Here we will highlight the specific categories of health data relevant to the agent's scope and list associated keywords and search terms for effective data discovery on Google and Kaggle. These keywords will be crucial for the agent's data acquisition strategy.

Data Categories (Examples): Disease prevalence, mortality rates, healthcare expenditure, vaccination coverage, demographic health data, environmental health factors.

- Keywords/Search Terms (Examples based on categories above):
- "diabetes prevalence data CSV"
- "global cardiovascular disease statistics Kaggle"
- "child mortality rates dataset WHO"
- "healthcare spending trends by country Excel"
- "COVID-19 vaccination rates time series data"
- "air pollution health impact data"
